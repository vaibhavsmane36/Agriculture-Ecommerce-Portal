Agri e-commerce – the buying and selling of agricultural produce online – can address notable challenges and inefficiencies in the agriculture supply chain by streamlining farmers access to the customer and creating new links between steps in the value chain. This is especially true in developing countries where online platforms can enable farmers to bypass intermediaries and sell directly to agri businesses, retailers, consumers and other customer groups, leading to increased efficiency of the supply chain and generating fairer incomes, as well as a transaction history for farmers.
Problem Statement:
The way people go about purchasing agricultural products is of great concern.Sometimes buyers have to travel far distances to get agricultural products and getting the right quality is not guaranteed. Also, various market prices cannot be compared because buyers do not have all the time and resources to visit every agricultural farm.
However, the true measure of e-commerce success comes with ability to address the challenges.
In day to day life, we will need to buy lots of goods or products from a shop. It may be food items, electronic items, house hold items etc. Now days, it is really hard to get some time to go out and get them by ourselves due to busy life style or lots of works. In order to solve this, B2C E-Commerce websites have been started. Using these websites, we can buy goods or products online just by visiting the website and ordering the item online by making payments online. 
Many customers go for purchasing offline so as to examine the product and hold the possession of the product just after the payment for the product.
